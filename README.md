Problem description. Suppose there are 5 Departments and 5 Programmers, each identified with an integer number between 1 and 5. You are to assign each Programmer to a Department according to the preferences given below. Each Department has a preference for the Programmers. For example, Department #1 preferences are as follows: 1 5 3 2 4, meaning that it would like to have programmer #1 as its first choice and programmer #4 as its last option. When there is a conflict, i.e., two Departments would like to have the same Programmer as their first choice, then consult with the Programmer in question, (that is, check his/her preferences) to determine which Department gets to hire him/her. When the program terminates, all Departments should have one programmer assigned to them.
Output:
Department #1 will get Programmer #1
Department #2 will get Programmer #3
Department #3 will get Programmer #5
Department #4 will get Programmer #2
Department #5 will get Programmer #4
